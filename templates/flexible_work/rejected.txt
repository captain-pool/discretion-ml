Hi %firstname%,
Thank you for submitting your flexible working request about %summary% (Reference ID: %id%).

Events happen in life, and I am here to support you through them.
In the discussion earlier, we agreed on some better, alternative arrangements to your initial proposal. Hence, I am declining your initial request. 

If you have any questions/concerns, please donâ€™t hesitate to discuss with me.

All the best,
Peter Varma
