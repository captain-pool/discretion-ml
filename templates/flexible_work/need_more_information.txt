Hi %firstname%,
Thank you for submitting your flexible working request about %summary% (Reference ID: %id%).

Events happen in life, and I am here to support you through them.

I will get in touch in the next 2 days to discuss your circumstances and agree on the next steps.

Your well-being is our top priority. The system suggested some ‘areas of consideration’ when you first raised the requests. Let’s discuss in the next meeting.
What and how I support you?
What would you be doing differently once you start the flexible working pattern? How would you manage a balance in the new circumstances? 

If you have any questions/concerns, please don’t hesitate to discuss with me.

All the best,
Peter Varma

Project Manager
