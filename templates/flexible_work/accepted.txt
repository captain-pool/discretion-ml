Hi %firstname%,
Thank you for submitting your flexible working request about %summary% (Reference ID: %id%).

This is to confirm the approval of your request based on your circumstances, policy guidance, and similar requests in the past.

Events happen in life, and I am here to support you through them.

Your well-being is our top priority. The system suggested some ‘areas of consideration’ when you first raised the requests. 
What and how I support you?
What would you be doing differently once you start the flexible working pattern? How would you manage a balance in the new circumstances? 

Please revisit them when things evolve. I will check in regularly with you on the situation too.

If you have any questions/concerns, please don’t hesitate to discuss with me.

All the best,
Peter Varma

Project Manager
